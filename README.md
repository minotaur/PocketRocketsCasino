Pocket Rockets Casino
===================

I decided to open source the client side Javascript code to allow users to help fix some of the smaller non 
critical bugs or add small improvements.

Each bug/feature has a Bitcoin bounty reward that the developer will receive on successful completion of the task.

If you feel an issue cannot be completed without some sort of server side modification please leave details as a comment 
and I will make the necessary changes.

It would be extra helpful if developers could work using TDD and write tests for their code using Jasmine. 
The Karma test runner is used.

Refactoring and adding extra tests is also welcome even if not associated with an issue. Substantial contributions will be 
rewarded in Bitcoin for their work here.

Feel free to submit own issues you may find while playing or reading the code.

All testing can be done on the play money tables without the need to deposit.

If you choose to work on an item assign it to yourself so no one else tries to work on it.
